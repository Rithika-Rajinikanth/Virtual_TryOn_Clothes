# 👗 Virtual Try-On Clothes (Flask Viewer)
This project provides a web-based viewer for displaying virtual try-on results generated by VITON-HD.
It reads test_pairs.txt from your dataset, matches person & clothing images with the generated output, and displays them side-by-side in a browser.

## ⚙️ Installation
### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Virtual_TryOn_Clothes.git
cd Virtual_TryOn_Clothes
```
### 2️⃣ Install dependencies
```
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt

requirements.txt should include:
nginx
Copy
Edit
Flask
```

#### Install the VITION_HD Database from the official Websites

### ▶️ Usage
```
Ensure your datasets/ and results/ folders are populated:

datasets/test_pairs.txt must contain lines in the format:

Copy
Edit
00000.jpg  cloth_01.jpg
00001.jpg  cloth_05.jpg
Generated images should be in results/ and follow the naming format:

Copy
Edit
00000_0.jpg
Run the Flask app:

bash
Copy
Edit
python viewer.py
Open your browser and go to:

cpp
Copy
Edit
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## 🧠 How It Works
Reads each line in test_pairs.txt to find person and clothing image names.
Looks for the corresponding generated try-on image in results/.
Displays all three images in a grid format in the browser.

## ⚠️ Notes
If the generated image is missing, it will not be displayed (a warning appears in the console).
If test_pairs.txt is missing, the app will show an error.
Make sure your static folder mirrors the dataset and result image locations, or adjust the paths in viewer.py.
